Screenshot showing the successful spike-in of known pathogenic variants, validated visually in IGV.
- **Variant**: chr2:119882574 C>T
- **Frequency:** 0.5
- **Gene**: PTPN4
- **Effect:** The PTPN4 c.538C>T (p.Gln180Ter) variant causes a premature termination codon, which is predicted to lead to nonsense mediated decay. Based on available information and the ACMG/AMP guidelines for variant interpretation (Richards S et al., PMID: 25741868), this variant is classified as likely pathogenic.
